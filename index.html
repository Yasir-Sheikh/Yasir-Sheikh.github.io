			<p>Intro to JS is a module introducing the fundamental concepts and ideas of scripting and more specifically java script.
			For me this module was the first introductory to java script. It taught me the concepts like how to use conditional
			statements, loops, and intro into object oriented programing. It also began to teach me how to make the programs
			interactive with the user in a more visual manner. I see myself using these concepts in the future to make programs 
			in my free time. Before this module making a game where the game responds to a about click was not something I was 
			knowleged about. Also, when I am employed as a programmer, I will have the ability to apply these concepts in game development.
			The part of the module that impacted me the most the ability to interact with the user and the program. In the previous year 
			most of the program was text based and no visuals. However, this year there was a visual component present in the modules. This
			allowed me to learn more user interfaces.</p>
			<h2> 2) Intro to HTML</h2>

			<p>The Intro to HTML module is a course taking you through the HTML, CSS and web desing. This module helped me learn the keys 
			ideas of how to design webpages. Without this module making the portfolio would be imposible. I learned concepts like how to 
			make links, how to add images and text to webpages. I can see myself using these concepts and tools to create future websites or 
			blogs. If I were to ever create a game or a social interactive app, then a website would be crucial for its success. Thus using 
			this knowledge would be fundamental in order to set up a successful bussiness plan. This is just one of many things I could use
			this module for in my future. This module impacted me the most by teaching me the fundamentals for html. This allows be to benefit
			in future whenever I am in need for a website. In this day and age knowing web design and programming is a must since the future is
			filled with technology.</p>
