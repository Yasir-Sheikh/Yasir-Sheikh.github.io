			<p id="p1">Intro to js is a module introducing the fundamental concepts and ideas of scripting and more specifically java script.
			For me this module was the first introductory to java script. It taught me the concepts like how to use conditional
			statements, loops, and intro into object oriented programing. It also began to teach me how to make the programs
			interactive with the user in a more visual manner. I see myself using these concepts in the future to make programs 
			in my free time. Before this module making a game where the game responds to a about click was not something I was 
			knowleged about.Also, when I am employed as a programmer, I will have the ability to apply these concepts in game development.</p>
