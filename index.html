			<h2>Top Ten Modules/ Projects of ICS4U </h3>
			<p> Hello, My name is Yasir Sheikh and I am current a ICS4U student. This my first of learning Java Script and I am
			excited to showcase the skills I have learned over the course.</p>
			</div>
			<h2 id="JS">  1) Intro To Js</h2>

			<p>Intro to JS is a module introducing the fundamental concepts and ideas of scripting and more specifically java script.
			For me this module was the first introductory to java script. It taught me the concepts like how to use conditional
			statements, loops, and intro into object oriented programing. It also began to teach me how to make the programs
			interactive with the user in a more visual manner. I see myself using these concepts in the future to make programs 
			in my free time. Before this module making a game where the game responds to a about click was not something I was 
			knowleged about. Also, when I am employed as a programmer, I will have the ability to apply these concepts in game development.
			The part of the module that impacted me the most the ability to interact with the user and the program. In the previous year 
			most of the program was text based and no visuals. However, this year there was a visual component present in the modules. This
			allowed me to learn more user interfaces.</p>
			<h2 id="HTML">  2) Intro to HTML</h2>

			<p>The Intro to HTML module is a course taking you through the HTML, CSS and web desing. This module helped me learn the keys 
			ideas of how to design webpages. Without this module making the portfolio would be imposible. I learned concepts like how to 
			make links, how to add images and text to webpages. I can see myself using these concepts and tools to create future websites or 
			blogs. If I were to ever create a game or a social interactive app, then a website would be crucial for its success. Thus using 
			this knowledge would be fundamental in order to set up a successful bussiness plan. This is just one of many things I could use
			this module for in my future. This module impacted me the most by teaching me the fundamentals for html. This allows be to benefit
			in future whenever I am in need for a website. In this day and age knowing web design and programming is a must since the future is
			filled with technology.</p>
			<h2 id="JS3">  3) Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h2>
			<img id="pic1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672286969447055380/paint.PNG">
			<p>Natural Simulations is a module based on the key idea of simulating nature within a program. This is acheive 
			implementing physics concepts like noise, froces and particles. This course walked had a fundamental object known as
			mover. This mover had the physics concepts applied on it to show a visual representation of what happens in the nature.
			I will continue using this as I am going to be studying engineering in university. Engineering requires a lot of understand
			of physics. However, with this knowledge I will be able to code a program that will help me visually understand the physics 
			concept. This module can help me get a visual representation of theory. The most impactfull thing on the module is the
			use of Object Orientated Programming. The heavy use of OOP in this module helped me with and ind depth understanding of how to
			use OOP.</p>
			<h2 id="Alg">  4) Algorithms</h2>
			<img id="pic1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672295752302723100/recursion.PNG">
			<p>The algorithms course is course walking you through the various algorithms like quick sort or selection sort.
			Another key idea taught in this course was the concept of recursion. recursion is commonly used
			in algorithms in order to repeat the algortihm until the data is sorted or the problem is solved. This module 
			will be usefull in the future as it allows me to sort complex data in a nice orderly manner. This means that if I
			were to ever be a softeware engineer, than sorted through a lot of data will not be difficult. Also as a software 
			engineer I will be expected to make algorithms to solve complex probelms. In times of need this module will be helpfull
			as it is a begining of my journey of learning about algorithms. This course impacted me the most by teaching me the concept
			of recursion. This was a concept I struggled with in the previous year. However the simplistic yet effective presentation here
			has helped me overcome a challenge I faced.</p>
			<h2 id="JS2">  5) Games and Visualizations</h2>
			<img id="pic1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672299996258893824/hoppy.PNG">
			<p>Games and Visualizations is module based on using java script to create games. This module including buttons,
			scaling and memory. This module helped me gain a deeper understanding of the process of creating games and how to
			make a game user friendly. This module will help me in the future as it opens up options for me. I have to option to work 
			as a game developer and contribute to an indutry im interested in. This module can also help kick off a business idea of 
			making small indie games. The most impactfull lesson off this module is the ability to make something creative. When I was 
			working on the project my creativity took over and I was able to implement into a program.</p>
			<h2  id="Astar"> 6) A* Pathfinding Algorithm</h2>
			<img id="pic1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672304086154215426/astar.PNG">
			<p>The A* Pathfinding algorithm is not a module on khan academy. This was the summitive project for a senior
			programming class (ICS4U). This summitive taught me how to apply the standard theory learned in class into a 
			app that I was working on. More importantly learning how to apply OOP into my own programs was something I was able 
			to put into practice. I will use this knowlegde to continue learning programming as I believe this program
			can be applied to other hobbies I have like chess. This can be used to create a efficient chess bot. This impacted 
			me by allowing me to understand team work in a programming enviroment. We were given goals/deadlines and we were able to
			meet do our parts in order to get our work done as a whole. I see this as a simulation of what it is like to work a 
			programming job.</p>
			<h2 id="CFuze">  7) CFuze </h2>
			<img id="pic2" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672309677018841131/CFuze.PNG">
			<img id="pic3" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672255790484291584/1234.png">
			<p>CFuze was the name of the hackathon app we were asigned to make in our ICS4U class. CFuze is an app in which
			two colors of choice can be chosen and will be returned as a mox of the two colors. This project can be used in my future
			as I can work towards expanding this idea. It will also help me continue learning as I am curious about how this can be 
			implemented work on different screens and not just the canvas provided to the program. This was impactfull on me as
			seeing it come together from nothing was new and exciting feeling for me. It made me realize that if I were to put mind
			to something then achieving it would be possible.</p>
			<h2  id="HTML2"> 8) Making webpages interactive </h2>
			<img id="pic1"src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672318044663709702/Cat.PNG">
			<p>This module was about making webpages interactive with the user. This included ideas like buttons, animated images and 
			DOM.This module helped me learn about how to make webapges that users can interact with. This will help continue learning computer
			science as I feel my knowledge of web development is incomplete. Thus I will strive to learn more about developing interactive 
			webpages. This module impacted me the most by introducing new and unique concpets to my knowledge. Also helping me increase my 
			skills with web development.</p>
			<h2 id="microbit" > 9) Microbit and Python</h2>
			<img id="pic5" src="https://microbit.org/images/beating-heart.gif">
			<p>The microbit assignment was an assignment where software was adding to a microbit in order to get one of 
			the microbit's function to operate. We chose to add a program which to send a message from one microbit
			to another. The other microbit served as a reciever. On reception, the microbit responded with a line. This
			project will help me continue learning more about the relation between software and hardware. Understanding ideas like  how
			the code from our computers screens interacts with the processor is one of many things I want understand about the relation
			between software and hardware. This imapcted me because it allowed me to work with logicboard. I am interested
			in understanding the circuitry that goes into allowing such a process to take place. This project gave me an insight 
			of how this works.</p>
			<h2 id="Computers"> 10) Computers </h2>
			<img id="pic1" src="https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/8/b/5/30683.jpg">
			<p> Computers is a module which explains the basics of computers and software. This module explains file sizez,
			compressions, binary, and computer parts. This module will help me continue learning as learning hardware is just 
			as important as software. Knowing only one half well makes your knowledge incomplete. Thus this module taught me 
			some of basics which I can continue to building on. The most impactfull idea in this module is the way compression
			works. This can help me better understand to manage storage on devices.</p>
